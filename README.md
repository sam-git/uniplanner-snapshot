# UniPlanner

*This repository is a snapshot of the web app code that was submitted for assessment with all private settings removed.*

UniPlanner is a collaborative web app designed for university students to gather and refer to their courses and assessment dates.
It allows students to associate their Facebook profile with each course they are currently taking. Each member gets an individual homepage that shows a customised study schedule and allows them to view the profiles of other students taking the same courses.

UniPlanner was a project I proposed as a fourth year project as part of my Software Engineering degree in 2013.
I wrote the majority of the server code in Python using Django. My project partner wrote the majority of the client code in CSS and HTML.

The web app was hosted on Heroku. In the final 2 weeks of the semester when UniPlanner went live, over 50 students used it to join up courses and share assessment dates with others in the same courses.
